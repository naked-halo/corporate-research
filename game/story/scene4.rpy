l "Impressive, isn't it?"
l "The building you're probably familiar with on the outside is just a front. Sure, some people live and work there, but the real stuff is here."
l "The Corporation is actually an arcology that extends some 300 meters underground. We've created a completely self-sustaining environment here."
r "Incredible…"
"It's like something out of a science fiction book."
"Beautiful buildings dot the streets, all with a bunch of wares, from handbags to fresh aquaponically grown food."
"There's even an electronics store, of all things."
show riley boobneutral
r "So does this place even need to interact with the outside world?"
show lily neutral
l "In theory, yes. We can work entirely in isolation."
l "In practice, we need some occasional contact with human society in order to perform our directives."
r "Directives?"
l "Our Progenitor ordered us to keep the planet in check, so of course we need to make sure that the planet is doing well."
show riley boobfrown
r "Well, you're doing a shitty job, to be honest."
r "Global warming, social classes getting more stratified, reality television…"
r "Face it, this planet is going down the tubes."
show lily smallsmile
l "From your human perspective, yes."
l "But remember that 200 years ago, an even larger majority of humanity lived in comparative squalor."
l "Most of your country has access to the Internet, are getting better and better medical technology, and, most importantly, have been enjoying a vastly superior way of life."
l "It's been a net improvement, to be sure."
r "But you still can't ignore the fact that global warming is still a problem."

l "That's true. At least, for now."
show lily neutral
l "The Corporation is working on a solution that should be ready in a few decades."
r "Decades? Don't you guys have super technology? There's no way you built this place with the tools humans have."
l "In some aspects we certainly have some better tech. But in reality, we're maybe only about 50 years ahead of human technology."
l "Humans are incredibly good at innovating with limited resources, and that's why your species has survived for so long."
l "Angels, on the other hand, are stronger, more durable, and functionally immortal."
l "We've been spoiled in that regard, so we lost our ability to innovate."
l "For the most part we've been piggybacking off of humanity's triumphs and making them better."
show riley booblaugh
r "Wow, never expected angels to be lazy."
show lily smallsmile
l "You're not that far off."
"I'm surprised at how candid Lily is being about her own race. Sure, angels are always depicted as these perfect, inscrutable beings, but I would have never known about how they run things here on Earth."
show riley boobquestion
r "Why tell me all of this, anyway?"
l "Because I can. That's all."
show riley boobsmile
r "Come on, you've got something up your sleeve. What is it?"
show lily neutral
l "I guess if you want a real answer… it's because a lot of the other angels are pretty boring."
r "Boring?"
l "Immortality dulls the mind a bit after enough time."
l "And sure, there are some of us who can make ourselves younger, but most choose not to."
l "I think the Eldest is a few millennia old, and she's about as interesting as a glass of water."
r "Are you saying this is a better conversation than what's available?"
l "Essentially. The younger angels are better, but they're few and far between."
"Wait, what's 'young' to her? Fifty years?"
r "Do you ever leave the arcology?"
show lily smallsmile
l "Oh, all the time. How do you think I got this tan?"
l "Most humans can't see the wings and the halo outside of the Corporation, so we can travel wherever we want without suspicion."
show riley boobneutral
r "Sounds nice. So, where do you travel to? Singapore? Japan?"
l "...Malibu."
show riley boobsurprise
r "Seriously?!? But that's only a few hours away by plane."
"Lily flexes her wings a little bit."
show lily neutral
l "These wings aren't meant for sustained flight. Even the most physically fit angels can only go for about an hour before having to rest."
show riley boobneutral
r "But why Malibu? You don't seem the type, no offence."
"Aside from the tan, of course."
l "It's warm and there's a lot of natural sunlight, something you can't get here."
l "Plus, the houses are nice."
"I never would have pegged the ultra serious Head Researcher as someone who'd go out of her way for some sunlight."
r "Fair enough."
r "So, where's this clothing store?"
"Lily points at a corner of the street we're walking on."
l "Just at the end there. We'll get something that fits your new…"
r "Go on, you can say it."
show lily embarrassed
l "Something that fits… your new breasts."
r "That's a new expression. Don't tell me…"
r "You like these, don't you?"
"I suggestively lift them up for her."
l "I-it's not like that!"
show riley booblaugh
r "Suuuure it is."

r "Whew, this is so much better."
"Lily also took the time to help me with a new outfit. Now that I'm bustier, she suggested that I get some new clothes to match, courtesy of her."
"I'm not one for fashion - heck, I barely go outside - but I have to admit, this looks pretty good on me."
l "Glad you think so."
show riley casual_boobneutral
r "All right, what's on the agenda for tomorrow?"
l "No, that'll be all. I have a few more experiments for you tomorrow, so please be ready."
r "...Sounds good."
l "Good night, Riley."

"I shed my clothes and prepare to relax for the evening."
show riley underwear_boobfrown
"Lily's reminder that there's still more experiments puts a damper on how effectively I can relax, though."
"If one of her experiments gave me these tits, what else does she have in store for me?"
"It doesn't really matter how nicely she treats me; I'm still at her beck and call for everything."
r "This sucks..."
"Even with the tempting prospect of growing even bigger tits while I'm here, there's no way I'm doing that again."
"..."
"At least I didn't have to pay money for these things."
"Heh, all I had to do was illegally embezzle a few grand and get abducted from my home."
"..."
"Well, might as well relieve some stress."
show riley underwear_boobarousedpants
"There's not a whole lot of material to get off to here, but I've managed before."
r "Mmh..."
r "Mirror. Lemme find a mirror."
"As if on command, a panel flips over to reveal a shiny mirror on the wall."
"Must be a mic hidden in here that responds to specific voice commands."
"I can finally look at my tits properly."
show riley underwear_boobarousednipple
"I pinch my nipples, which have somehow been made more sensitive by all of this growing they've been doing."
r "Ohhh fuck, that's good."
"I can see my hands sinking into my chest. They're everything I've dreamed about what big tits are like."
hide riley
"I spend the rest of the evening examining my new figure."
"If I'm going to be stuck here, I might as well get as much mileage out of the new benefits this place offers me."

"The next day arrives. Feeling somewhat refreshed after last night, I manage to wake up early and arrive at the lab."
"Surprisingly, Lily hasn't arrived yet."
r "That's strange."
"I kind of expected her to be here a few minutes early."
"No other angels are in here, either."
"I wonder..."
"I walk over to Lily's desk and attempt to pull open the cabinets."

"Damn. Locked."
"Lily doesn't appear to need a computer terminal - that tablet everyone seems to have probably interfaces here somewhere."
"With nothing else, I take a look on her desk and see if I can find anything."
r "Let's see..."
"A budget folder, department memos, and a few post-it notes don't reveal much."
"The budget seems to be from last year, but there's something on the page that catches my eye."
"'Artifical phallic delivery system for cytogel -- Δ333,700'"
"What? Did she seriously develop a fancy dildo?"
show riley casual_booblaugh
r "Heh, I guess even angels can't resist a good cock."
l "Find something interesting?"
show riley casual_boobsurprise
r "Ah!"

"I nearly drop the papers as Lily surprises me."
show riley casual_boobembarassed
r "Shit, didn't realize you were there."
r "Uh, sorry about reading your... stuff."
l "No offense taken. If I didn't want you reading it, I would have locked it up."
show lily smallsmile
l "Ready for today's experiment?"
show riley casual_boobneutral
r "S-sure."
"Lily reaches over to one of the cabinets I tried opening, revealing a series of black boxes."
"Opening one, she pulls out..."
show lily dildo
"Oh God."
l "I need you to masturbate with this."
r "Seriously?"
"The dildo in question is a pale, translucent blue, with what appears to be a small dial embedded inside where the testicles would be."
"It's also... pretty big."
show lily smallsmile
l "Like it? I developed it myself. Just finished production of the commercial models last year."
l "There's plenty of settings for you to try, so knock yourself out."
show riley casual_boobfrown
r "No pills or any other surprises today?"
show lily neutral
l "The pills you took were for Phase One of my experiments."
l "Now that we successfully proved that they can modify tissue, I need to develop another version that uses the data I've collected from you."
l "I expect that this'll take a while, so feel free to take the day off."
l "Just be sure to use the dildo tonight and report back to me tomorrow."
r "Any 'surprises' this time?"
show lily smallsmile
l "All the instructions are in the box. Feel free to read up on how it works."
show riley casual_boobsurprise
r "Huh. Okay."
show riley casual_boobsmile
r "I guess I'll get going, then!"
