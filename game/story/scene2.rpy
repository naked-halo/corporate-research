"The room is small. Cramped. 'Cozy' would be the absolute nicest thing someone would call it."
"A bed occupies one side of the room, with a wall-mounted TV and tiny coffee table on the other."
woman "Toilet and shower are in through that door over there. You can order food and other amenities with this device here."
"She pulls out a small tablet from the wall and hands it to me."
"It's a make and model I can't determine. Might be something only available here."
woman "That's your access pass into my lab, too. Don't lose it."
r "Right. Got it."
woman "Anything else?"
r "This is… it?"
woman "That's it. Report to me at seven AM sharp tomorrow."
"She abruptly turns and heads out to leave."
r "Wait!"
woman "What?"
r "What's… your name? I never caught it."

l "Welcome aboard, Riley."
"Somehow, hearing her name is a bit of a relief. The nature of this place feels so alienating."

"Before I can say anything else, Lily nods her head and leaves."
"That's it. I'm all alone now."

r "Shit…"
"It takes all of my remaining energy to collapse into the bed nearby."
"I'm dragged into here and treated as barely human, and on top of it all, I have to work for someone who's as unreadable as a brick wall."

"And those… experiments… what the hell is going to happen to me?"

"Fuck. It wasn't."
"The tiny room lights up a little bit as I get out of the bed."
"I try to go through as much of a normal morning routine as I can: washing my face, brushing my teeth (with the world's smallest toothbrush), and ordering some food from the app on my tablet."

"Surprisingly, the bagel I order slides out of a panel in the wall. It's even warmed up."

show riley mad
r "...Morning."
l "Now that you're here, I need to prep you for today's experiment."
r "Prep?"
l "Since you came from outside, all employees are subjected to a hot, cleansing shower to remove any impurities."
r "So basically you're saying I'm jam-packed with dirt and need to clean up?"
show lily frown
l "No, I'm saying that if you had a nasty contagion somewhere on your person, the experiments could make that worse."
"Oh."

"A glowing panel catches my attention."
show riley surprise
"Oh, this must be the touchpad. Nice."
show riley neutral
r "Purple...purple…"
"A button on the panel labeled 'Heavy Duty Cleanse' catches my eye. Sure enough, it's purple."
"If I didn't know any better, I'd say that Lily has a very subtle sense of humor."
r "What am I, a car?"
"Whatever. I'm delaying the inevitable by standing here."
"The panel glows, starting up some motors behind the walls."
"A panel pops out, with the text 'CLOTHING DEPOSIT' glowing on it."
show riley nude_neutral
"I strip down and put my clothes away. The panel retracts, with the text changing to 'CLEANING...' soon after."
"Huh. Convenient."
"Well, if this gonna be a hot shower, it better be a good one."

"The shower head erupts with a torrent of water."
"Ooh, it's not bad. Kind of warm and… tingly?"
"It's the ideal temperature after one of the worst days of my life."

"What's that?"
"In front of me, several sponges attached to some mechanical arms emerge from the ground."
"Oh no, I don't need a robo-sponge bath…"
show cg_shower3
"Two arms behind me, anticipating my movements, hoist me up by my hands and let their scrubbing counterparts get to work."
r "HEY! STOP! ABORT! CEASE!"
"It's no use. The scrubbing begins as they start with my head and shoulders, then move down to my armpits and chest."
r "Nggh…"
"Out of all the places on my body, these things have to target where I'm fucking sensitive. Of course."
"The scrubbing feels stiff and mechanical - each one does a specific behavior and moves to the next step without a break."
"I grin and bear it for a while longer."
#whirr sfx
r "Now what?"
show cg_shower4
"Another arm emerges, this time close to my…"
r "Oh fuck no. Come on, really?!?"
"Before I can try to dodge, the sponge starts to carefully wipe and clean up my groin."
r "Mmhhh…"
"Okay, that's… not bad."
"The sponge down there squirts out a few jets of lukewarm water."
r "Okay, smartass. Stay there and keep going."
"Surprisingly the arm continues, with a few blasts of water every few seconds."
"Fuck, I could get used to this."
"The jets continue for a few more minutes as I writhe in place, trying to forget that I'm getting off via robot."
"How pathetic."
r "Just a little more..."
r "Hahh..."
#whirr sfx
"Before it starts getting good, the machine stops, signaling the end of my shower."
"I'm a bit miffed, but whatever. I'll finish things off later tonight."
"The room blasts me with hot air, getting me dried up in a short amount of time."
"My clothes pop out of the panel with a little ding, looking a lot cleaner than when I put them in."
r "Time to face the music..."

"With my body and all of my clothes finally cleaned up, I head back and report to Lily for my assignment."
l "All right. Looks like you've cleaned up nicely. You should be free of any trace of disease, so that'll eliminate any unforeseen consequences."
r "That's what it was doing?"
l "More or less."
"Interesting. There might have been some kind of compound in that water that helped."

r "What, really? No injections or patches?"

l "It's also orange-flavored."
r "Any reason for that?"
l "Not really."
"I grab the pill from Lily and start chewing it."
"Well, she wasn't lying about the flavor..."
r "Not bad."
r "Now what?"
l "Just relax in your quarters for the rest of the morning. You got up early so feel free to catch up on some shut eye."
