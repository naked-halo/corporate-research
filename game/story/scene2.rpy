"The place is small. Cramped. 'Cozy' would be the absolute nicest thing someone would call it."
"It's sparsely decorated with some furniture."
"Unlike some of the model apartments I've seen, there's no knick-knacks or extraneous junk anywhere."
"It's the absolute minimum living space for a human to live in."
"There's a small couch in the corner, with a wall-mounted TV and tiny coffee table."
"Behind there is a small kitchenette with what appears to be a... fancy vending machine?"
woman "Your bed is down the hall. Toilet and shower are in through that door. You can order food and other amenities with this device here."
"The woman gestures to the screen near us."
woman "Just touch the screen and order. There's different stuff every day, so feel free to explore and find what you like."
woman "Food will arrive through the slot on the side in a few minutes."
woman "Oh, and you'll need one of these."
"She pulls out a small tablet from the wall and hands it to me."
"It's a make and model I can't determine. Might be something only available here."
woman "Corporation-brand tablet. Syncs with all the devices here and elsewhere."
woman "You'll find that we have a completely secure intranet for videos, a basic messaging system, and a way to order goods, should you need them."
woman "I'll remind you that as per your contract, you are barred from accessing outside networks."
"I grumble at that last bit. No way to call for help."
woman "That tablet your access pass into my lab, too. Don't lose it."
r "Right. Got it."
woman "Anything else?"
r "This is... it?"
woman "That's it. Report to me at seven AM sharp tomorrow."
"She abruptly turns and heads out to leave."
r "Wait!"
woman "What?"
r "What's... your name? I never caught it."

"Two arms behind me, anticipating my movements, hoist me up by my hands and let their scrubbing counterparts get to work."
r "HEY! STOP! ABORT! CEASE!"
"It's no use. The scrubbing begins as they start with my head and shoulders, then move down to my armpits and chest."
r "Nggh..."
"Out of all the places on my body, these things have to target where I'm fucking sensitive. Of course."
"The scrubbing feels stiff and mechanical - each one does a specific behavior and moves to the next step without a break."
"I grin and bear it for a while longer."

"Another arm emerges, this time close to my..."
r "Oh fuck no. Come on, really?!?"
"Before I can try to dodge, the sponge starts to carefully wipe and clean up my groin."
r "Mmhhh..."
"Okay, that's... not bad."
"The sponge down there squirts out a few jets of lukewarm water."
r "Okay, smartass. Stay there and keep going."
"Surprisingly the arm continues, with a few blasts of water every few seconds."
"Fuck, I could get used to this."
"The jets continue for a few more minutes as I writhe in place, trying to forget that I'm getting off via robot."
"How pathetic."
r "Just a little more..."

"Before it starts getting good, the machine stops, signaling the end of my shower."
"I'm a bit miffed, but whatever. I'll finish things off later tonight."

l "All right. Looks like you've cleaned up nicely. You should be free of any trace of disease, so that'll eliminate any unforeseen consequences."
