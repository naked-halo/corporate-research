    "By the time we get back to the lab we're both in an interesting conversation about angel biology."
    r "So, angels were created after humans were?"
    l "Yes. Sometime after the first major population of Homo Sapiens was already on the planet, Our Progenitor made us based off of your template."
    l "From what we understand we were meant to be a significant improvement over the base model, but humans have changed quite a bit."
    l "Nowadays, our only major advantages are our enhanced speed and strength."
    r "So humans are the prototype, while angels are the commercial model?"
    l "Heh, well said."
