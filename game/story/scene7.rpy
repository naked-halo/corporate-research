    "By the time we get back to the lab we're both in an interesting conversation about angel history."
    r "So, angels were created after humans were?"
    l "Yes. Sometime after the first major population of Homo Sapiens was already on the planet, Our Progenitor made us based off of your template."
    l "From what we understand we were meant to be a significant improvement, but humans have changed quite a bit."
    l "Nowadays, our only major advantages are our enhanced speed and strength."
    r "So humans are the prototype, while angels are the commercial model?"
    show lily smile
    l "Heh, well said."
    show riley maternity_medpreg_question
    r "So who exactly is this Progenitor? God?"
    l "If you're talking about the biblical God... kind of."
    l "Our records indicate that Our Progenitor started influencing things here on Earth about 250,000 years ago."
    l "Coincicdentally, that's just around the time modern humans emerged."
    r "Why Earth? Did this guy go to any other planets?"
    l "Mars and Venus, you mean? They were already at their current state when they arrived."
    l "Completely uninhabitable."
    l "It seems Earth was an ideal testing ground for Our Progenitor, with a wide variety of life, and one species that deserved attention."
    show riley maternity_medpreg_surprise
    r "Humans?"
    l "That's right. Your species has the uncanny ability to adapt to any living condition."
    l "Coupled with your high intelligence, you were poised to become the dominant species of the entire planet."
    l "However, Earth was not a kind home for you."
    show riley maternity_medpreg_neutral
    l "Droughts and other natural disasters were bottlenecking your species, and extinction was likely without intervention."
    l "So Our Progenitor decided to give things a little push in the right direction."
    r "Like what?"
    l "Well, a few dozen millenia later, humans were encouraged to move out of Africa and into other parts of the world."
    l "At the same time, angels were created from a few select humans as a means to assist."
    l "Eventually, humans had settled into their new homes and angels were done with our first major project."
    r "So what happened to you after that?"
    l "Our Progenitor gave us one final directive: nurture the planet."
    l "And then... they left."
    r "With such a vague directive, you'd think this Progenitor would given you guys more powers."
    r "And made your species fertile."
    l "That's the thing: we originally were able to have children of our own."
    l "Slowly, however, we started losing that ability."
    l "We're pretty sure that resetting our bodies every thousand or so years affected our ability to reproduce."
    l "We still retain our abilities, but we've struggled to find a way to reverse this trend."
    r "I don't suppose you could get this Progenitor to come back, could you?"
    l "We've tried contacting them. Unfortunately, we don't know where they went."
    l "For all we know, they're in some distant galaxy doing something similar with another alien species."
    r "So all of your work is going to manipluate what your creator built on? Doesn't that come with risks?"
    show lily neutral
    l "A lot. For one, it could degrade our DNA even further and cause us all sorts of problems."
    show riley maternity_medpreg_surprise
    "I blanch."
    r "Wait, then what about me?"
    l "Oh, don't worry. I've made sure that that particular scenario can't happen."
    show riley casual_medpreg_neutral
    r "Phew. Good."
    l "We have access to our genome so it's pretty easy to look at genes and figure out what needs to be modifed."
    l "Since the human genome is virtually identical, it was easy to test new medicaton on."
    r "So I guess you weren't kidding when you said you needed a human for this role."
    r "Since you can't determine if angels could even survive, you had to test on something equivalent."
    r "If things went wrong and angels started dying, then you'd have a dwindling supply of people keeping the planet together."
    "Lily nods."
    l "Hence why I picked you. You came to us at the perfect time."
    l "Thanks to you, what would have been at least 10 years of red tape was trimmed down to a few hours of paperwork."
    show riley maternity_medpreg_question
    r "You're welcome, I guess?"
    l "Speaking of, I'll have the next experiments ready after your next growth spurt. I'll keep monitoring you in the meantime."
    r "Sure thing. Anything you want me to do in the meantime?"
    l "Can you fill out this paperwork for me?"
    r "..."
    r "Not what I had in mind, but sure."

    "Being pregnant for 15 months... Hopefully I don't get too much bigger."
