    "By the time we get back to the lab we're both in an interesting conversation about angel biology."
    r "So, angels were created after humans were?"
    l "Yes. Sometime after the first major population of Homo Sapiens was already on the planet, Our Progenitor made us based off of your genetic template."
    l "From what we understand we were meant to be a significant improvement over humans."
    l "However, humans have changed so radically over the past few millennia in terms of intellect that now that gap is significantly smaller."

    l "Heh, well said."

    r "So who exactly is this Progenitor? God?"
    l "If you're talking about the biblical God... kind of."
    l "Our records indicate that Our Progenitor started influencing things here on Earth about 250,000 years ago."
    l "Coincicdentally, that's just around the time modern humans emerged."
    r "Why Earth? Did this guy go to any other planets?"
    l "Mars and Venus, you mean? They were already at their current state when they arrived."
    l "Completely uninhabitable."
    l "It seems Earth was an ideal testing ground for Our Progenitor, with a wide variety of life, and one species that deserved attention."
    show riley maternity_medpreg_surprise
    r "Humans?"
    l "That's right. Your species has the uncanny ability to adapt to any living condition."
    l "Coupled with your high intelligence, you were poised to become the dominant species of the entire planet."
    l "However, Earth was not a kind home for you."
    show riley maternity_medpreg_neutral
    l "Droughts and other natural disasters were bottlenecking your species, and extinction was likely without intervention."
    l "So Our Progenitor decided to give things a little push in the right direction."
    r "Like what?"
    l "Well, a few dozen millenia later, humans were encouraged to move out of Africa and into other parts of the world."
    l "At the same time, angels were created from a few select humans as a means to assist."
    l "Eventually, humans had settled into their new homes and angels were done with our first major project."
    r "So what happened to you after that?"
    l "Our Progenitor gave us one final directive: nurture the planet."
    "Angels sure have a strange history."
    r "With such a vague directive, you'd think this Progenitor would given you guys more powers."
    r "And made your species fertile."
    l "That's the thing: we originally were able to have children of our own."
    l "Slowly, however, we started losing that ability."
    l "We're pretty sure that resetting our bodies every thousand or so years affected our ability to reproduce."
    l "We still retain our abilities, but we've struggled to find a way to reverse this trend."
    r "I don't suppose you could get this Progenitor to come back, could you?"
    l "We've tried contacting them. Unfortunately, we don't know where they went."
    l "For all we know, they're in some distant galaxy doing something similar with another alien species."
    r "So all of your work is going to manipluate what your creator built on? Doesn't that come with risks?"

    l "A lot. For one, it could degrade our DNA even further and cause us all sorts of problems."

    "I blanch."
    r "Wait, then what about me?"
    l "Oh, don't worry. I've made sure that that particular scenario can't happen."
    show riley casual_medpreg_neutral
    r "Phew. Good."
    l "We have access to our genome so it's pretty easy to look at genes and figure out what needs to be modifed."
    l "Since the human genome is virtually identical, it was easy to test new medicaton on."
    r "So I guess you weren't kidding when you said you needed a human for this role."
    r "Since you can't determine if angels could even survive, you had to test on something equivalent."
    r "If things went wrong and angels started dying, then you'd have a dwindling supply of people keeping the planet together."
    "Lily nods."
    l "Hence why I picked you. You came to us at the perfect time."
    l "Thanks to you, what would have been at least 10 years of red tape was trimmed down to a few hours of paperwork."

    r "You're welcome, I guess?"
    l "Speaking of, I'll have the next experiments ready after your next growth spurt. I'll keep monitoring you in the meantime."
    r "Well, anything else on the menu today?"
    l "Not in particular. You're not experiencing any more growth for a while, so we'll be taking it easy for the next few weeks."
    r "All right."
    l "With all of the data I have on you, I'll be developing a new pill for you to try."
    l "After your next growth spurt you'll be testing their effectiveness."
    show riley maternity_medpreg_neutral
    r "These better not make me grow a penis."
    l "Don't tell me you're still hung up on that?"
    l "I'm still a ways off on making a pill that can modify genitalia to that degree."
    l "I think at the most, you'd just be making your current genitalia much bigger."

    r "My junk's plenty big, so I'll pass."
    l "Suit yourself. Well, see you tomorrow!"

    "Bigger genitalia aside, it sounds like Lily has a reason for me to be here."
    "While at first I thought I'd just be testing drugs, the fact that Lily needs me in order to solve an issue her entire race has been struggling with is kind of interesting."

    "If anything, it makes carrying this thing a bit more bearable."
    r "Jeez, everything looks smaller now."
    "Being pregnant for 15 months... Hopefully I don't get too much bigger."
    "Still..."

    "Regardless, I think I'll try to enjoy this pregnancy now."
