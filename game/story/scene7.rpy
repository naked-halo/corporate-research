    "By the time we get back to the lab we're both in an interesting conversation about angel biology."
    r "So, angels were created after humans were?"
    l "Yes. Sometime after the first major population of Homo Sapiens was already on the planet, Our Progenitor made us based off of your genetic template."
    l "From what we understand we were meant to be a significant improvement over humans."
    l "However, humans have changed so radically over the past few millennia in terms of intellect that now that gap is significantly smaller."

    "Angels sure have a strange history."
    r "Well, anything else on the menu today?"
    l "Not in particular. You're not experiencing any more growth for a while, so we'll be taking it easy for the next few weeks."
    r "All right."
    l "With all of the data I have on you, I'll be developing a new pill for you to try."
    l "After your next growth spurt you'll be testing their effectiveness."

    r "These better not make me grow a penis."
    l "Don't tell me you're still hung up on that?"
    l "I'm still a ways off on making a pill that can modify genitalia to that degree."
    l "I think at the most, you'd just be making your current genitalia much bigger."

    r "My junk's plenty big, so I'll pass."
    l "Suit yourself. Well, see you tomorrow!"

    "Bigger genitalia aside, it sounds like Lily has a reason for me to be here."
    "While at first I thought I'd just be testing drugs, the fact that Lily needs me in order to solve an issue her entire race has been struggling with is kind of interesting."
    "If anything, it makes carrying this thing a bit more bearable."

    "Okay, I take back what I said all those weeks ago."
    "This is gettting really fucking annoying."
    "My belly is enormous now; it's gotten to the point where it's further out than my boobs."
    "What's more, all of my organs have shifted around so I can't eat much lest I get sick."
    "Thank God I didn't get morning sickness during all of this, either."
    "According to Lily the cytogel only releases a few painkillers and dopamine to help with my growing body."
    "All the stuff you normally hear about pregnancy - the nausea, the mood swings, and even stuff like lactation - haven't happened."
    "I guess I could call myself lucky..."
