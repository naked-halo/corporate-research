"My alarm goes off, but I don't care."
"I'm fat and sexually satisfied after last night."
"I think Lily will understand if I'm a little bit late today."
"That ice cream was really dense, though. How'd they make that?"
r "Can't believe I ate the whole pint…"
"I didn't eat anything else after that, so it's fine, right?"
"Shouldn't be too problematic for me."
"I hug my pillow and allow myself a few more minutes of sleep."

"— up?"
"I almost fall out of the bed as I notice something's off."
"My sense of balance is weird somehow."
"It only takes a second to see why."
"There's a… bulge."
"It's… strangely hard. It's not fat, then?"
"Suddenly, I realize why."
r "Oh no…"
"I look over at the box the dildo came in."
"'The Immaculate Conception...'"
show cg_preg2
"Holy fucking shit, that dildo DID impregnate me!"
"How is this possible?"
"I look like I'm at least two or three months pregnant - what the hell was in that cytogel stuff?"
"What's inside ME?!?"

"My voice sounds weak."

l "Well then, congratulations on your pregnancy."
r "That's not funny!"
l "Relax, it's not a real pregnancy."
l "The cytogel that was implanted into you is a simple multicellular organism that feeds off the excess nutrients in your body."
l "Over the course of a few months it grows much like a human fetus would."
"She looks at my belly."
l "Yours has grown quite a lot in the past few hours… did you eat a lot of sugar after getting implanted?"
r "Shit…"
l "Ah, that would explain it. No worries. Yours will probably grow to its maximum size in a few weeks."
l "After a few more months, the organism naturally breaks down and is absorbed into the bloodstream."
"Hold on. Months?!?"
l "It's very clean, and it's the only way some angels get to experience pregnancy."
l "We're sterile, after all."
l "Initial research shows that a lot of us have some level of pregnancy fetish, especially with the whole pregnant 'look'."
l "That's why it's so fast-acting; for getting that belly nice and big."
l "Right now there's a subset of angels who like wearing fake pregnancy bellies..."
r "I don't care! I don't want this thing inside me!"

l "I'm afraid neither of us have that choice. I don't have the authority to break your contract, so you're stuck with me."
r "But…!"
l "I'm sorry. Hands are tied."
r "W-well you can get rid of this… gel thing, right?"
l "...I'm afraid that's not an option, either."
r "What?!? Didn't you invent this thing?"
l "Correction: I invented the delivery system, not the cytogel."
l "The cytogel is something we've had for a few decades, actually."
l "This is actually the first time we've implanted it into a living being for this purpose."
l "I've been assigned to observe the growing cytogel and monitor its artificial life cycle."
l "Which, if my calculations are correct…"
l "Will be a range from six to fifteen months."
show riley casual_pregshock
r "..."
r "Fifteen months?"
"She does know that a normal human pregnancy only lasts nine, right?"
l "Obviously, we won't try to extend the pregnancy, but we'll need to check."
l "I'll need to do more experiments on you, naturally."
l "Since this is part of your contract, this'll be a few more months of testing to check on your overall health."
l "I suppose I'll start with —"
"I don't even hear her next words."
"Realization hits me: I'm really, truly stuck here."
"I'm impersonating a pregnant woman with a body that's no longer recognizable to me."
"Was leaving even an option?"
