 "I'm suddenly aware that it's dark."
 "There's something over my head, and it's hard to hear what's going on around me."
 "Where am I?"
 guard "...Take her to Section 227."
 "I'm roughly pulled up by my arms and half-dragged down what I guess is a hallway."
 "I can barely keep myself upright - I think these guards sedated me or something when they grabbed me from my apartment."
 "Speaking of, what the hell? Who are these guys?"
 "..."
 "Damn, I can't tell which way we're going. Are we going up or down?"
 "It takes some time, but we finally stop moving."

 scene interrogation_blindfold
 "I'm ushered into the room and shoved into a chair, then tied into it."
 woman "All right. This is the girl?"
 guard "Affirmative. We foresaw that this girl would be hacking into our networks, so we apprehended her as soon as possible."
 "What, what the hell? They KNEW?!?"
 "No way. No goddamn way. My scripts are airtight."
 "Everything I do is designed to be foolproof."
 "Shit. Shit. Shit!"
 "I try to struggle against my restraints. If they figured out it was me I'm dead."
 woman "Hey! Get the relaxant!"
 scene interrogation_blindfold_removed
 "Before I can act any more, someone injects me. The effect is immediate and I lose all control in my arms and legs."
 woman "Looks like you understand your situation."
 "The woman addressing me snaps her fingers and the blindfold is removed."
 scene interrogation_no_blindfold
 "I can't make out the face of the woman in front of me; it's too bright."
 woman "Riley Miller. Age 23, 158 centimeters, 80 kilograms..."
 r "Hey!"
 woman "Relax, this is a judgement-free zone."
 "She's holding a big stack of papers and idly paging through them."
 woman "Riley, we discovered several offshore accounts in your name, all with several thousand near-identical deposits of two cents made every day."
 woman "We also picked out where those deposits were coming from."
 "She shows me a transaction record from a few big corporations."
 "Indez, Macrosoft, JoyFoods... Damn, these people are good."
 woman "You've made quite a bit of money from this little penny-pinching venture, haven't you?"
 r "No shit, Sherlock. Of course I did."
 woman "You do realize that's... illegal, right?"
 r "..."
 "Come on, really? She's not an idiot, she knows that it's questionably legal at best."
 woman "I'm waiting."
 r "..."
 r "Technically, yes."
 woman "I'll take that as an admission."
 woman "Several days ago, you accessed one of our offshore servers in an attempt to find some financial information, right?"
 "I grind my teeth."
 r "I knew that was too easy to get intoâ€¦"
 woman "After your latest acquisition of funds, we decided to take action and, well, leave the door open, so to speak."
 woman "After that, it wasn't too difficult to trace your location and positively ID you."
 "So they already had plans to take me out."
 "What kind of organization is this?"
 woman "After you've been processed here, you'll be taken to the local authorities and arrested for wire fraud and embezzlement."
 woman "Your trial will probably take a few weeks, but then you're off to a solid 25 years in federal prison, and that's IF you have a good lawyer."
 woman "Of course, it doesn't need to be that way."
 r "What do you mean?"
 woman "Here, let's get you in a more comfortable position."

 "There's a strange circle around this woman's head, and are those..."
 woman "Yes, they're real. No, you can't touch them."

 r "Shit. What is this..."
 woman "Now. I can offer you an alternative to prison time."
 woman " Should you accept, you'll be working for me in my laboratory as an assistant and test subject."

 r "Test subject? For what?"
 show lily smallsmile
 woman "That's classified for now."
 woman "Don't worry, I'm not going to vivisect you or pump you full of drugs."
 woman "I just need a good, healthy human who can follow orders."
 "She - the angel - slides a sheet of paper over to me."
 "It's a long, wordy contract for employment with a job description similar to what she described."
 "Like she says, I'll be testing a bunch of stuff for her. Gels, medication, plus a few more incidentals."
 "'Guinea Pig' would be a better descriptor of what I'd really be doing for this woman."
 "At the bottom there's a space for me to sign."
 woman "So? What do you think?"
 "She dangles a pen in front of me."
 r "...Gimme a minute."
 "Well, she's not really giving me any choice here. 25 years in jail sucks ass."
 "At this point it's just a formality. She already has what she wants - me."

 r "All right. Fine. You win."
 "I grab the pen and sign my name on the paper."

 "Huh. And here I thought it was going to glow or magically bind my soul or something."
 "But I'm... fine?"
 show lily neutral
 woman "Is there a problem?"
 show riley arms normal nude mad
 r "Several."
 woman  "Such as?"
 r "Why bother with all of this? You could have just kept me strapped to a chair and asked me to do whatever, right?"
 show lily frownhips
 woman "You think we're running some sort of illegal operation here? Please."
 woman "I've got countless Archangels breathing down my back every day. If they caught a whiff of me breaking any of their precious procedures I'd be stripped of all my research."
 woman "We do things by the book here, contracts and all."
 r "That still doesn't excuse the fact that you guys fucking kidnapped me!"
 "She glares at me more intensely than I thought possible."
 woman  "You did hack into our corporate database, right?"
 woman  "We have every right to protect our Corporation from outside intrusion. That includes humans like you."

 "She whips out what appears to be an e-cigarette and inhales deeply."

 "Ugh. Smells obnoxiously fruity."

 woman  "Whatever the circumstance, you're officially an employee of The Corporation now. You're reporting to me, so I'll be taking care of you, as per the terms of the contract."
 woman  "Follow me."
 "I don't really have any other choice, so I follow her as she exits the room."

 woman  "Welcome to my laboratory."
 r "Your laboratory?"
 "It's full of everything you'd expect a mad scientist to have - beakers, whiteboards, the works."
 woman  "We work on a lot of things here, from new construction compounds to medicine."
 "Several angels look towards us, parting ways for the woman to pass through unimpeded."
 show lily smallsmile
 woman  "I'm the director, of course."
 woman  "You'll be working for me as my personal assistant for my latest projects."
 r "Which are?"
 woman  "I need to study your day-to-day reactions under specific conditions to test some new medications I've been tinkering with."
 r "That's it? Why can't another angel do it?"
 show lily neutral
 woman "Angels are lacking in a few critical areas, I'm afraid. You, though, have everything I want in order to test things out."
 woman "But, you're clearly in no condition today. Allow me to take you to your living quarters."
