"Something's up. There's no way she'd just let me take a few pills every day."
"Especially with all of the dirt she's got on me."
show riley nervous
"Shit, she's got something planned, I know it."
"I'll have to be on my guard."

show riley frown
r "...Fine."
"Lily observes me for a moment, clearly aware of my hesitation around her."

r "I mean, you can say that, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm not exactly here by choice."
r "You know this was basically a way to recruit people 'legally' and look squeaky clean, right?"

l "I'm gonna have to stop you there."
l "Full disclosure: this shit is the nicest treatment The Corporation offers."
l "You think you're the only human here? Think again."
l "I had to pull a lot of strings just to get you on my team. Your original assignment wasn't pleasant."
show lily neutral
l "You're a talented woman, Riley. It would be a waste to keep you in some obscure corner of the business."
r "..."

"So she thinks that because she pulled me out of the trash heap she gets to push some pills on me?"
"What a load of shit."
r "I still don't like you, you know that?"
show riley neutral
r "I'm only doing this because I signed that contract, all right?"
r "I don't have to like it, just follow orders."
l "..."
r "You want me to take this? Fine."
"I chew and swallow the second of what I assume are another dozen pills."
r "Anything else?"
"She holds up a flash drive and tosses it to me."
l "I would like for you to watch this video in your quarters. Return once you're done."
show riley shrug
r "Fine. Whatever."

"Now that I'm back in the room, I decide to take a look at the flash drive Lily gave to me."
"It's a sleek, black piece, with what appears to be a slider to push out the USB part of the drive."
"Honestly, I'm surprised it's not something more advanced. Wouldn't it be easier to stream it to my monitor in here?"
r "Let's get this over with, I guess."
"I slide the drive into the monitor and take a seat."
"It immediately lights up as the video starts."

"The video is...weird. Like, I don't really understand what's going on."
"It's some strange art piece that flips and scrambles an image of a few statues while some weird buzzing plays in the background."
"And yet…"
"I can't stop looking at it."
"There's something deeper about this video. If I can just take a look at that part again…"
video "What… do you want?"
"A voice suddenly emanates from the monitor."
video "What...do you want?"
"The video shifts to another statue and the buzzing, droning sounds intensify."
"What do I want?"
"I mean, I want to get out of here, for starters."
video "What… do you want to change?"
"Change?"
video "Change… is good."
"The droning continues as I'm pulled into the screen."
"I'm sinking, falling, drowning into the void as the video takes me on a wild ride."
video "Change yourself…"
video "Change yourself…"
r "Change myself…"
"I can't look away."
"Change myself...what do I want to change about myself?"
"Hmm... Oh, I know!"
"My breasts! I've always been kind of insecure about how small mine are."
"I concentrate and think about bigger tits."
"..."
r "Hmm... let me try that again."
"I focus again, this time concentrating on how my breasts will fill and swell."
"I start feeling hot."
"And then..."

r "Fuck yes."
"They've definitely grown! Holy shit, these feel amazing."
"I've toyed with getting implants but this is way better!"
r "Wonder if they could get even bigger..."
"Without even having to concentrate I feel my chest heating up again, and the skin starting to stretch to accomodate my growing bustline."
scene cg_video3
r "Shit..."
"They're huge. Massive, enormous tits."
r "At least an E cup. Goddamn."
"I think that's what the pill was for. Did Lily make something that can change someone's body with a thought?"
"What's in there? Nanomachines? Hormones? Am I just having a vivid hallucination?"
"There's only one way to find out."

"So they are real."
show riley embarassed
r "Sh-shut up! What was in that pill?"
l "The exact formula is something I can't disclose to you."
l "But just know that when the pill is consumed, it accelerates your natural biological state with enough concentration."
r "Whatever. All right, I'm ready to be changed back. There's a way to reverse this, right?"
l "..."
"She pulls out her tablet and taps a few buttons."
l "Frank? I have a patient that needs breast reduction surgery..."
r "WOAH WOAH WAIT, WHAT?!?"
l "Ah, belay that for a second."
r "What about your pills? Can't I just take one and it'll make my breasts return to normal?"
show lily frownhips
l "Didn't you hear me? Your natural biological state was accelerated."
l "Basically, the pill hit fast-forward on your breast size, and you controlled when they stopped."
l "You can't reverse something like that, unless you can reverse entropy, too."
l "Those are permanent, unless you decide to go under the knife."
show riley boobmadcrossed
r "..."
r "You could have warned me."
show lily neutral
l "Unfortunately, that would have invalidated the experiment. The subject needs to be unaware in order to maximize the effect."

"I sigh."
r "I'd be lying if I said I didn't always want bigger tits."
r "I guess... I'll deal with it for now."
show lily smallsmile
l "I will say that your prodigious growth is a sign that we're onto something."
l "Excellent work, Riley. I expect more results tomorrow."
r "Right, then. Anything else for today?"
l "Nope, that's it."
l "Have you explored the rest of the place yet? Any questions?"
r "Any clothing stores?"
"I point to my huge bustline."
r "I need a new bra."
l "Ah, of course. How about we kill two birds with one stone, then?"
