"The next few weeks go by in a hazy, indescribable blur."
"I'm poked and prodded by Lily every day, who takes her sweet time going through all of the data."
"According to her, I'm 0.0035% Scandinavian."
"Huzzah."

"Meanwhile, my 'baby' is healthy and continuing to grow."
"It's only been about twenty or so days, but my belly has swollen to the equivalent of someone who's six months pregnant."
"Lily swears that it doesn't move, but last night I swore it kicked."
"Who knows, all of these experiments are messing with my head, so it could be an hallucination."
"If she's right this could grow even larger."
"I don't know how much longer this pregnancy will last, either."
"So I'll probably look like an expectant mother for God knows how long."
"A freak with a swollen, protruding belly, who has to waddle everywhere."

"I'll need to push back a little in order to prevent any other bizarre changes to my anatomy."
"Girding myself, I get dressed and head over to Lily's lab."

l "Good morning, Riley. How are you feeling?"
r "The usual. Still pregnant."

"Every morning, I'm asked to strip for inspection while Lily examines my womb and the growing cytogel inside."
"At this point it's just routine. Lily's actually pretty gentle with her prodding."
l "All right, it looks like it's not going to grow for a while."
r "But it's still going to grow?"
l "That's right. If the simulations I'm running are correct it should hit another growth spurt in another two months."
l "After that, it'll be at its maximum size."
r "Fun."
"Lily sighs."
l "Look, Riley..."
l "I know that what's happened to you is unfortunate, but I want to try and make things better for you."
r "Don't you think you've done enough for me already?"
"I gesture to my curvy figure."
r "I really don't want any more... alterations on your account."
l "I was going to suggest that, actually."
l "I can do some less involved experiments and instead focus on the quality of the pregnancy you're experiencing."
l "Things like this would enhance the immersion for angels."
r "And the pills you're making me take every day?"
l "Right now we're doing an extended control experiment, so unless there's a strong trigger, there should be no more changes."

r "All right. That kind of makes things more bearable."

r "Any chance you have an estimate for how much longer I'll be carrying this thing?"
l "I can't say for sure, but it's definitely going to be a few more months."
l "Maybe closer to the full fifteen."

l "The cytogel is still very healthy and accepting nutrients from you."
l "So, I can't change that, but at the very least you don't need to worry about more body changes."
r "..."
"Even with her reassurances, I'm still stuck with a fake pregnancy that feels all too real."
