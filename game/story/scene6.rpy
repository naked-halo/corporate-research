"The next few weeks go by in a hazy, indescribable blur."
"I'm poked and prodded by Lily every day, who takes her sweet time going through all of the data."
"According to her DNA analyis, I'm one-sixteenth Scandinavian."
"Huzzah."

"Meanwhile, my 'baby' is healthy and continuing to grow."
"It's only been about twenty or so days, but my belly has swollen to the equivalent of someone who's six months pregnant."
"Lily claims that it doesn't move, but last night I swore it kicked."
"Who knows, all of these experiments are messing with my head, so it could be an hallucination."
"If she's right this could grow even larger."
"I don't know how much longer this pregnancy will last, either."
"So I'll probably look like an expectant mother for God knows how long."
"A freak with a swollen, protruding belly, who has to waddle everywhere."

"I'll need to push back a little in order to prevent any more bizarre changes to my anatomy."

l "Good morning, Riley. How are you feeling?"
r "The usual. Still pregnant."
l "I can see that. Okay, it's time for your morning checkup."
show riley raised medpreg nude sad
"Every morning, I'm asked to strip for inspection while Lily examines my womb and the growing cytogel inside."
"At this point it's just routine to me."
show lily neutral
r "Sooo, anything new?"
l "Well..."
"She takes her time with her next words."
l "Well, while the cytogel is fine, it's due for another growth spurt soon."
r "Geez, really?"
"I'm not surprised, honestly."
l "Unfortunately, yes. I'll have to monitor things a bit more closely over the coming days."
show lily smallsmile
l "According to the data we have so far, the next growth spurt should be the last."
"I guess that's good news, or what Lily considers to be good news."
r "When's it going to happen?"
l "That I'm not sure about yet. Could be next week... or next month."
show riley arms medpreg nude shrug
r "Well, I guess that's something to look forward to, then."
r "We done here?"
"Lily nods, prompting me to put my clothes back on."

r "Ugh..."
show lily surprised
l "Riley, are you okay?"
show riley arms medpreg casual embarassed
r "I-it's nothing!"
r "Just... trying to get everything back on."
l "I was going to mention this but..."
show lily question
l "Do you need some new clothes?"
l "Your pregnancy has, er, stretched a few things to their limits."
r "So you've noticed..."
"I really didn't want to admit it, either, but I really didn't want to say that out loud."
show riley arms medpreg casual shrug
r "All right."
r "This place doesn't sell any maternity wear, do they?"
l "Hmm... Well, actually..."

r "..."
r "There's no fucking way I'm going out with this thing on."
l "I'm sorry, but that's all there is available."
r "Are you kidding? This is all they have?"
l "I think that's the point of this outfit, actually."
r "I guess if there's no other choice..."

"Ugh. I look ridiculous."
"My belly sticks out, emphasized by the open nature of the top I'm wearing."
"At least things are covered. I nearly had a heart attack seeing the more risque options."
l "I think it looks nice on you, Riley."
r "Don't tell me you're one of those pregnancy fetishists too."
show lily embarassed
l "N-not really..."
show riley arms medpreg maternity smirk
r "You know you're a horrible liar, right?"
"Of course she's one. She developed that dildo, after all."
l "It was a request from a very influential member of that group."
l "I just... happened to be affiliated with her, and she requested that I make it."
show riley arms medpreg maternity question
r "So you're part of the group and she commissioned your side of the business to make one?"
l "...In a way, yes."
show riley crossed medpreg maternity neutral
r "Seriously? Why use the fake gel stuff when you could just as easily make angels pregnant?"
l "Well, that's actually why you're here, Riley."
show riley arms medpreg maternity surprise
r "Huh?!?"
l "I'm tring to see if I can use the pills I developed to make us fertile."
l "We have a womb and ovaries, but they're pretty much vestigial."
l "We haven't had an angel pregnancy in 12,000 years."
l "The cytogel is a step in the right direction - after all, emulating a pregnancy means that we could potentially support a real one."
r "Wow, that's what you've been doing?"
show riley arms medpreg maternity laugh
r "I'm... actually impressed."
"I'm not being sarcastic, either. Whatever mad science Lily is cooking up, it seems it has a fairly noble cause."
l "If I can make angel pregnancies a reality, then we can be better equipped to handle a host of issues the planet has."
show riley arms medpreg maternity smile
r "More angels mean more staff, you mean?"
l "Essentially, yes. Even though everyone here works for The Corporation, we're in need of making more offices elsewhere."
l "We'd like to make a smaller arcology in Europe, but with our numbers stretched thin, we can't afford to."
l "More angels concieved via pregnancy would be the best way to add to our numbers."
r "Seems logical."
show riley arms medpreg maternity question
r "Wait, how would you guys get pregnant? You don't have any males anymore, right?"
l "...I have a few ideas on how to fix that."
show riley arms medpreg maternity smirk
r "What, like growing a penis?"
l "..."
l "That's one option, yes."
show riley arms medpreg maternity smile
r "That's an interesting way to solve the problem."
show lily neutral
l "It requires more research on my part, though."
show lily smile
l "Still, it should be possible. Our DNA is slightly different from humans, so we could potentially develop hermaphroditic structures..."
