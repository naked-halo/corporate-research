"The next few weeks go by in a hazy, indescribable blur."
"I'm poked and prodded by Lily every day, who takes her sweet time going through all of the data."

"Huzzah."

"Meanwhile, my 'baby' is healthy and continuing to grow."
"It's only been about twenty or so days, but my belly has swollen to the equivalent of someone who's six months pregnant."
"Lily swears that it doesn't move, but last night I swore it kicked."
"Who knows, all of these experiments are messing with my head, so it could be an hallucination."
"If she's right this could grow even larger."
"I don't know how much longer this pregnancy will last, either."
"So I'll probably look like an expectant mother for God knows how long."
"A freak with a swollen, protruding belly, who has to waddle everywhere."

"Every morning, I'm asked to strip for inspection while Lily examines my womb and the growing cytogel inside."
"At this point it's just routine. Lily's actually pretty gentle with her prodding."
l "All right, it looks like it's not going to grow for a while."
r "But it's still going to grow?"
l "That's right. If the simulations I'm running are correct it should hit another growth spurt in another two months."
l "After that, it'll probably be at its maximum size."
r "Fun."
